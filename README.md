# quadcopter
This projects began with 5 main goals:

1. Assembly all the necessary hardware and essencial software to be able to make the quadcopter's propellers work controlled by a radio
2. Make it "stay still" in air (might need ultrasound and/or barometer)
3. Control yaw/pitch/roll with radio, keeping stability automatically
4. Do a rollover with a single button
5. Have a camera attached to it capable of "tracking" (ie, pointed to the same location even when the quadcopter moves)
